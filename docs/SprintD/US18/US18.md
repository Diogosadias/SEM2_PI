# US 18 - Send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression model to use and select the independent variables to use.*


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the Specifications Document:**

US18: As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression model to use and select the independent variables to use.

Acceptance Criteria: The system should allow the Administrator to select
between a simple linear and multilinear regression model to fit the data.
Moreover, the Administrator should be able to choose the independent variable to use with the simple linear regression model (either the number of tests realized or the mean age). The system should send the report using the NHS API (available in moodle).

"...requires Many Labs to summarize and report Covid-19 data, the company
needs to:: identify the number of Covid-19 tests performed, identify all positive results to Covid-19
tests, report the total number of Covid-19 cases per day, per week and per month of the year, and
send the forecasts for these same time horizons (the number of Covid-19 cases for the following
day, next week and next month)."

"To make the predictions, the NHS contract defines that a linear regression algorithm should be used.
The NHS required that both simple linear and multiple linear regression algorithms should be
evaluated to select the best model. The accuracy of the prediction models should be analysed and
documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be delivered with the
application. The algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration
file."


**From the client clarifications:**



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* AC1: Admin must select between simple linear and multilinear regression model to fit the data. This should be defined with the help of a configuration file.
* AC2: Admin can use 2 variables for the regression model (Number of tests or mean age of tested)
* AC3: Admin must select the dates for the report and the historical points.
