# US 18 - Send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression model to use and select the independent variables to use.*


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the Specifications Document:**

US18: As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression model to use and select the independent variables to use.

Acceptance Criteria: The system should allow the Administrator to select
between a simple linear and multilinear regression model to fit the data.
Moreover, the Administrator should be able to choose the independent variable to use with the simple linear regression model (either the number of tests realized or the mean age). The system should send the report using the NHS API (available in moodle).
