# US 14 - Make Diagnosis and Write Report

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a specialist doctor, I intend to make the diagnosis and write a report for a given test.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the Specifications Document:**



**From the client clarifications:**



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* ACX:


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  : starts new CAL	 |		...creating a new CAL?   |  Company -> CALStore           |Based on the Creator standard (Company used to store the list of all CAL ) on the MD, the responsibility is attributed to the Company. By application of HC + LC in Company the responsibility is delegated to CALStore|
| Step 2  : requests data(i.e., Lab ID, Lab Name, Address, Phone Number, TIN Number, performs covid-19 tests)		 |			n/a				 |             |                              |
| Step 3  : types requested data		 |			...saving the input data? 				 |    CAL       | IE: the object created in the first step has knowledge of its own data.                             |
| Step 4  : shows the data and requests confirmation	 |		...validate that the data is according to AC?					 |  CAL         |   IE: Know its own creation rules.                           |
| Step 4  : shows the data and requests confirmation		 |		...validate the data persistence?					 |        Company -> CALStore     |  Based on the IE (Company used to know all the CAL Objects ) but, with the application of HC+LC in Company, the responsibility it's know delegated to CALStore| |              
| Step 5  : confirms data		 |				...saving the CAL registered?			 |      Company -> CALStore         | Based on the IE standard on the MD, the responsibility is attributed to the Company. By application of HC + LC in Company the responsibility is delegated to CALStore, as previously stated. |              
| Step 6  : informs operation success		 |			...informing operation success?				 |      UI       |    IE:Responsible for user interaction.                          |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * XXX
 * 

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
* XXX

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections.*
