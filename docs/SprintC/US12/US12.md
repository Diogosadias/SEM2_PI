# US 012 - Record Tests Result

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**Q1:** The results of the tests can be negative or there are any restriction in this particular variable?

**A1:** The result/value of one parameter is related with the type of parameter we are measuring. To get an idea, please check the values returned by the external modules (jar APIs).

**Q2:** When you intend to record the results of the Blood Test, do you want to introduce all results for all parameters or just only one?

**A2:** The clinical chemistry technologist should record all results related to a test at a given time/moment.

**Q3:** According to the project description the external modules should be used by the specialist doctor when creating the diagnosis, so, shouldn't the acceptance criteria of the external modules be applied on US 014 instead of US 012?

**A3:** The reference values should be presented both to the clinical chemistry technologist (US12) and to the specialist doctor (US14). In the Project description we get: "To facilitate and simplify the validation work [make a diagnosis and write a report] performed by the specialist doctor, the application uses an external module that is responsible for doing an automatic validation using test reference values.

**Q4:** What information is the system going to have to ask the clinical chemistry technologist to be able to create the test results?

**A4.1:** The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find (in the system) the test for which the sample was collected.

**A4.2:** The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the (selected) test.
All parameter values of the test should be filled/defined (by the Clinical Chemistry Technologist) when the use case finishes.

From the Acceptance Criteria we get that "the API request should include, at most: (i) a key to access the module (e.g.: “KEY1234”); (ii) a parameter identifier; (iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference measurement unit (e.g. "mg")."

**Q5:** Does this "at most" express that there are some parameters of the API request that are optional? If so, could you clarify the parameters that are optional?

**A5:** "At most" means the maximum number of parameters that will be used. Depending on the API being used, all parameters above may be required or some may be optional.The number of parameters depends on the API that is being used.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The application should use an external module that is responsible
for providing the test reference values. The application can use an external module for
each type of test.

**AC2:** For instance, when the results are for blood tests parameters, the
externalmodule BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for
Covid-19 tests parameters, the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used.

**AC3:** In any case, the API request should include a key to access the module (e.g.:
“KEY1234”), a parameter identifier, the reference date, and reference
measurement unit (e.g. "mg").

**AC4:** The number of parameters depends on the API that is being used

**AC5:** The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the (selected) test.
All parameter values of the test should be filled/defined (by the Clinical Chemistry Technologist) when the use case finishes.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Starts a new test result record  		 |		...instantiating a new test result record?					 | ExternalModule            | IE + LC                             |
| Step 2: Requests data 		 |				...for inputting the data?			 |         n/a    |                              |
| Step 3: Types requested data 		 |			...saving input data?				 |   ExternalModule        |    IE: Knows inputted attributes                         |
| Step 4: Confirms the data		 |				...saving the data?		 |     TestStore        |               IE: Knows Tests attributes               |
| Step 5: Informs operation success  		 |	...informing operation success?					 |         UI    | IE: Responsible for user interactions                              |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Test
 * Parameter
 * ExternalModule

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RecordTestResultUI  
 * RecordTestResultController
 * RecordTestResultStorage

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![US12-SD](US12-SDref.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US12-CD](US12-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*
